## 🌐 Web App

We have developed an interactive **web application** to automatically identify and visualize large **cosmic ray (CR) hits** for close inspection.
The app provides:

* **Live CR mask visualization** over the input FITS images
* **Manual editing support** for refining the CR masks
* **Dynamic threshold tuning** for adapting to various observational datasets

This tool is handy for astronomers to fine-tune **detection thresholds** and **inspect CR contamination patterns** interactively.

🚀 **Upcoming Update:**
We are actively adding new features — the **final version with transformer-based CR segmentation and analysis** will be released soon!
